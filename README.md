# **Bookmark Landing Page**

This is a simple **landing page** project for a **bookmark manager**, built to practice and explore **Styled Components** in React.

The design is from **Frontend Mentor**, implemented as part of a styling exercise.

## **Why This Project?**

I wanted to **learn and experiment** with **Styled Components**, so I created this landing page as a hands-on way to get comfortable with:

- **Dynamic styling** based on props
- **Scoped component styles**
- **CSS-in-JS best practices**

This project isn't focused on advanced functionality or complex state managementâ€”it's primarily a **styling exploration**.
